Hello, I’m Aaron, but I go by @AaronHongry on the internet!
I’m interested in front-end web development but I am very open to learning new things to discover what I truly like.
I’m currently learning more on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and will most likely learn frameworks/libraries such as Bootstrap and React.js
